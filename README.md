# MACC-game_of_life_Pandemic_simulator
From the game of life (cellular automata) created by john Horton Conway, create design new present rules implementing the possibility of contagion of different diseases creating another possible way of death

Problem: Lack of awareness about the impact that a virus can have on a society and the little importance that is given to individual actions.

Course objective: Create a new version of the game of life â€œIt is a two-dimensional cellular automaton in which each cell (cell) can be alive or dead. Starting from an initial state, the simulation makes the automaton evolve. " (John Conway, 1970) where there is a cell with the characteristics of a virus. By analyzing the behavior of the society made up of cells, raise awareness about the impact that a virus can have on a society and the importance of individual actions.

With the work team there are 3 specific objectives that are: the graphical interface, declaration of new rules and creation of analysis of the simulations.
